This is an IOS prototype application to showcase basic interactions and knowledge of segues and view controllers by using assets which denote the sign up and create account flow of the dropbox application 

Time spent:7 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

1. Setup
2. Welcome screens
3. Create account / Sign in
4. Terms of Service
5. Signed In, New User
6. Signed In, Existing User
7. Logging Out

Notes:
I had to redo the whole application because I accidentally "Removed reference" for the mainstory board. Because of this I did not have the time to work through optional stories.
